/**
 * rooms.ts represents the game data that drives the story. It should contain all of the
 * elements that are needed to tell the story. Although it is currently written in
 * TypeScript, it should only contain objects which could just as easily be JSON. The
 * reason to make this file TypeScript for now is that it lets the TypeScript compiler
 * tell us if we have made errors. Later, we should add a file parser that can figure out
 * if there are errors in a JSON file and load it if there are not.
